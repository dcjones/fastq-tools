Rename hash.h/c to hash_table.h/c.

Seperate murmurhash into it's own file: hash.h/hash.c.

Document fastq-sort.

More comparison functions for fastq-sort.

Link against quip so we can run these tools on quip/fastq/bam/sam with one
interface.

Make a website for fastq-tools.

An option to return the sequences that match past a certain threshold would be
useful.
