fastq-tools
===========

This package provides a number of small and efficient programs to perform common
tasks with high throughput sequencing data in the FASTQ format. All of the
programs work with typical FASTQ files as well as gzipped FASTQ files.

The following programs are provided. See the individual man pages for more
information.
