Introduction

The Smith-Waterman [1] algorithm is one of the most sensitive sequencing 
algorithms in use today.  It is also the slowest due to the number of 
calculations needed to perform the search.  To speed up the algorithm, it 
has been adapted to use Single Instruction Multiple Data, SIMD, instructions 
found on many common microprocessors today.  SIMD instructions are able to 
perform the same operation on multiple pieces of data parallel.

The program swsse2 introduces a new SIMD implementation of the Smith-Waterman 
algorithm for the X86 processor.  The weights are precomputed parallel to the 
query sequence, like the Rognes [2] implementation, but are accessed in the 
striped pattern.  The new implementation reached speeds six times faster than 
other SIMD implementations.

Below is a graph comparing the total search times of 11 queries, 3806 residues,
against the Swiss-Prot 49.1 database, 75,841,138 residues.  The tests were run
on a PC with a 2.00GHz Intel Xeon Core 2 Duo processor with 2 GB RAM.  The 
program is singlely threaded, so the number of cores has no affect on the run 
times.  The Wozniak, Rognes and striped implementations were run with the 
scoring matrices BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62 and four different gap penalties, 10-k,
10-2k, 14-2k and 40-2k.  Since the Wozniak's runtime does not change depending
on the scoring matrix, one line is used for both scoring matrices.

Build Instructions

    * Download the zip file with the swsse2 sources.
    * Unzip the sources.
    * Load the swsse2.vcproj file into Microsoft Visual C++ 2005.
    * Build the project (F7).  For optimized code, be sure to change the 
      configuration to a Release build. 
    * The swsse2.exe file is in the Release directory ready to be run.

Running

To run swsse2 three files must be provided, the scoring matrix, query sequence
and the database sequence.  Four scoring matrices are provided with the 
release, BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62 and BLOSUM80.  The query sequence and 
database sequence must be in the FASTA format.  For example, to run with the 
default gap penalties 10-2k, the scoring matrix BLOSUM50, the query sequence 
ptest1.fasta and the sequence database db.fasta use:

     c:\swsse2>.\Release\swsse2.exe blosum50.mat ptest1.fasta db.fasta
     ptest1.fasta vs db.fasta
     Matrix: blosum50.mat, Init: -10, Ext: -2
